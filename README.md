# Sollet - A crypto wallet

- The aim of this wallet that makes crypto transactions as effortless and smooth as traditional payment methods. The vision is to encourage users to rely on this wallet for everyday purchases and financial activities, making cryptocurrency more accessible and practical for daily life.

- While many wallets share user data as a means to generate revenue, we believe there's a better way. Maintaining a wallet requires funding, but rather than compromising user privacy, this project proposes an alternative model. By incorporating non-intrusive ads within the wallet interface, we can generate the necessary revenue without selling user data. This ensures that users can enjoy a secure, privacy-focused wallet while still allowing the platform to remain financially viable.

- One more feature I would like to add is the Watcher feature, which will help traders monitor cryptocurrency flows effectively. With this feature, anyone can track the transactions of businesses, empowering traders to follow the movement of funds and stay ahead in the world of cryptocurrency.
